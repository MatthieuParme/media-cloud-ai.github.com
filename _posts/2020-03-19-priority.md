### First goal
Be able to finish first workflows before start new ones.  
It's important for lot workflows parallel processing, it reduce the storage needs.  

### Technical description
Each step ID is unique and initially ordered and started by 0.  
As the need it to increase the priority while the workflow progress, the first idea it to match this ID to the priority.  
In RabbitMQ, the maximum priority is 255, but the maximum level recommended is 10 as more priority levels are defines, more the RabbitMQ server load increase.  
For the use case, queues are defined with a maximum level of 100.  
  
### Changes
For Step Flow, the priority is took directly from the step ID - clamped to 100.
Each worker consumer create the queue with the max priority header equal to 100.
RabbitMQ order jobs to consume first higher priority jobs.
